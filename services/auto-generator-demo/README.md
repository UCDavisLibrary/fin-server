# Auto Generator Service

This service is a demo of using a WebhookService to auto generate containers based on existing container updates.  It uses the fin-node-utils AutoGenerator server to listen to
create/update events on Collections and then adds a simple container with a counter that increments each time a parent collection container update event is fired.

## Basic pattern

When a Webhook create event comes in for a container that should have a auto generated child, the generator should create the child container.  If you want to set some initial state in the container that is fine, however, you should NOT do a lot of work here.  Wait for the modified event to do your work.  When you create the new child container the parent will fire a modified event, so to prevent doing work twice hold off on your operation until the modify event.

When creating a container you should ALWAYS include `http://library.ucdavis.edu/fin-server#AutoGeneratedContainer` as a type.  The generator service should then watch for this type and ignore any container with the AuthGeneratorContainer type to avoid recursive badness.  The fin-node-utils AutoGenerator class has this build in.

When a modify event comes in the service should preform any required work and patch the auto generated child container with the result.
