# Siege test for the library

This is a small test for testing the connection speeds of the DAMS.  This is
pulled from another project, so currently it' not correct.  In the end we hopeto
be able to add a set of siege configuration files, and receive a set of results
via a Makefile.  Probably we will not start this up be default, but will require
an exec command.
